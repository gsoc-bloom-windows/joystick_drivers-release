Description: ROS2 driver for a generic Linux joystick.
 Will contain a MacOS and Windows version later. The joy package contains joy_node, a node that interfaces a generic Linux joystick to ROS2. This node publishes a &quot;Joy&quot; message, which contains the current state of each one of the joystick's buttons and axes.
